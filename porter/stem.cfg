#
#
# 2. THE ALGORITHM
# 
# To present the suffix stripping algorithm in its entirety we will need a few
# difinitions.
# 
# A \consonant\ in a word is a letter other than A, E, I, O or U, and other
# than Y preceded by a consonant. (The fact that the term `consonant' is
# defined to some extent in terms of itself does not make it ambiguous.) So in
# TOY the consonants are T and Y, and in SYZYGY they are S, Z and G. If a
# letter is not a consonant it is a \vowel\.
# 
# A consonant will be denoted by c, a vowel by v. A list ccc... of length
# greater than 0 will be denoted by C, and a list vvv... of length greater
# than 0 will be denoted by V. Any word, or part of a word, therefore has one
# of the four forms:
# 
#     CVCV ... C
#     CVCV ... V
#     VCVC ... C
#     VCVC ... V
# 
# These may all be represented by the single form
# 
#     [C]VCVC ... [V]
# 
# where the square brackets denote arbitrary presence of their contents.
# Using (VC){m} to denote VC repeated m times, this may again be written as
# 
#     [C](VC){m}[V].
# 
# m will be called the \measure\ of any word or word part when represented in
# this form. The case m = 0 covers the null word. Here are some examples:
# 
#     m=0    TR,  EE,  TREE,  Y,  BY.
#     m=1    TROUBLE,  OATS,  TREES,  IVY.
#     m=2    TROUBLES,  PRIVATE,  OATEN,  ORRERY.
# 
# The \rules\ for removing a suffix will be given in the form
# 
#     (condition) S1 -> S2
# 
# This means that if a word ends with the suffix S1, and the stem before S1
# satisfies the given condition, S1 is replaced by S2. The condition is
# usually given in terms of m, e.g.
# 
#     (m > 1) EMENT ->
# 
# Here S1 is `EMENT' and S2 is null. This would map REPLACEMENT to REPLAC,
# since REPLAC is a word part for which m = 2.
# 
# The `condition' part may also contain the following:
# 
# *S  - the stem ends with S (and similarly for the other letters).
# 
# *v* - the stem contains a vowel.
# 
# *d  - the stem ends with a double consonant (e.g. -TT, -SS).
# 
# *o  - the stem ends cvc, where the second c is not W, X or Y (e.g.
#        -WIL, -HOP).
# 
# And the condition part may also contain expressions with \and\, \or\ and
# \not\, so that
# 
#     (m>1 and (*S or *T))
# 
# tests for a stem with m>1 ending in S or T, while
# 
#     (*d and not (*L or *S or *Z))
# 
# tests for a stem ending witha double consonant other than L, S or Z.
# Elaborate conditions like this are required only rarely.
# 
# In a set of rules written beneath each other, only one is obeyed, and this
# will be the one with the longest matching S1 for the given word. For
# example, with
# 
#     SSES -> SS
#     IES  -> I
#     SS   -> SS
#     S    ->
# 
# (here the conditions are all null) CARESSES maps to CARESS since SSES is
# the longest match for S1. Equally CARESS maps to CARESS (S1=`SS') and CARES
# to CARE (S1=`S').
#

stemmer:
  # In the rules below, examples of their application, successful or otherwise,
  # are given on the right in lower case. The algorithm now follows:

  #
  # If the second or third of the rules in Step 1b is successful, the following

  # letter pair. The -E is put back on -AT, -BL and -IZ, so that the suffixes

  # 4.

  # The test for the string S1 can be made fast by doing a program switch on

  # breakdown of the possible values of the string S1. It will be seen in fact

  #
  # The algorithm is careful not to remove a suffix when the stem is too short,
  # the length of the stem being given by its measure, m. There is no linguistic
  # basis for this approach. It was merely observed that m could be used quite
  # effectively to help decide whether or not it was wise to take off a suffix.
