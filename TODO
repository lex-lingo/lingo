= ToDo list for lingo

(most important first)

== General considerations

* New code *should* meet the guidelines outlined in the
  RubyStyleGuide[https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide],  
  existing code will be adjusted along the way.
* New comments and documentation and stuff *should* be in English, existing
  texts will be translated as time allows. Use Ri18n or Ruby-GetText for the
  UI (to not loose existing translations).

== Specific features

* Reorganize file and module structure (directories: bin/, config/, dict/,
  lib/{lingo,tasks}; Lingo namespace).
* Refactor Rakefile (lib/tasks/).
* Update some older documentation (particularly, the README).
* Package lingo as gem, allowing it to be installed system-wide, with user
  documents, dictionaries and configuration files separate from system files
  and dictionaries. (Location for user configuration and dictionaries, maybe:
  ~/.lingo)
* Use OptionParser (optparse) or similar for command-line processing instead
  of custom-made routines.
* Allow for handling of documents in various encodings, not just the one the
  dictionaries are encoded in.
* Provide automatic encoding detection.
* Provide automatic language detection (as fine-grained as possible).
* Make lingo run faster!? (benchmark - profile - optimize)
* Replace SDBM by DBM (more platform-independent, no 1k limit on record size);
  maybe QDBM/Tokyo Cabinet or even CDB for faster access.
* In-memory (volatile) vs. on-disk (persistent) dictionaries. It should be
  possible to simply use the Lingo API without caring about dictionary storage.
* That being said, provide an easy-to-use Lingo API -- just 'require "lingo"'
  and go for it!
* In addition to that, provide sensible string extensions: String#tokenize,
  String#lemmatize, ...
* Provide a DSL for configuration -- in addition to, or instead of, the current
  YAML format.
* Make sure the Crypter is sufficiently secure.
* Use RSpec for testing.
* Make Lingo capable to use multiple cores or even machines to boost performance by 
  connecting Attendees through sockets and use separate processes
